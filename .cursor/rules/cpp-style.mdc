Title: C++ house style for Cursor

Function layout
return_type
FunctionName(args)
{
/* declare all variables first /
/ then statements */
}

Declarations
Place all variables at the start of each function. No mixed declarations later in the body.

Spacing
Put exactly two blank lines between function definitions. No extra blank lines.

Braces
Opening brace on a new line for functions, classes, structs, and namespaces.

Comments
Use only C style comments like /* ... */. Do not use // comments. Write only necessary comments.

Headers
Do not add banner blocks or long headers. Keep files lean.

Edits
When editing existing files, preserve the style above. Keep diffs minimal. Do not inject extra comments.

Whitespace
No trailing spaces. End each file with a single newline.

Example
/* good */
int
Add(int a, int b)
{
int sum;

sum = a + b;

return sum;
}


int
Mul(int a, int b)
{
int prod;

prod = a * b;

return prod;
}
